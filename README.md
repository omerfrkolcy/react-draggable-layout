# react-draggable-layout

This project is a React application that uses the `react-grid-layout` library to provide a drag-and-drop interface.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Users can easily move items around on the page by clicking and dragging them.
- **Responsive Layout**: The layout automatically adjusts based on the size of the user's screen.
- **Customizable Grid**: Users can customize the grid to their liking, including the number of columns, row heights, and more.
- **Persistent Layouts**: The layout is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists even when the page is refreshed.
- **Dark Mode**: The application supports a dark mode theme, which can be toggled on and off by the user. The selected theme is also saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists even when the page is refreshed.
- **Material UI**: This project uses Material UI, a popular React UI framework, for its component design. This ensures a modern, responsive user interface with a consistent design language.
